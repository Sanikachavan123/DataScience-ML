<h3> 1) Admission Prediction</h3>
Predicts the likelihood of a student getting admitted to a university.
In this project, I built a model that estimates a student's chances of admission based on factors like GRE score, TOEFL score, and GPA. It's a handy tool for aspiring grad students to gauge their admission prospects.
